# Pomodoro Timer ⏱️  

A clean, distraction-free Pomodoro timer built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, featuring motivational quotes and three timer modes (Pomodoro, Short Break, Long Break).  

> **What is a Pomodoro Timer?**  
> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals, typically 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. It’s designed to improve focus and productivity. As someone who thrives with structure and has ADHD, I’ve found the technique incredibly useful for maintaining momentum. I created this version as a minimalist productivity companion — adding my own personal touch with a rotation of motivational and existential quotes that resonate with me.

## 📖 About This Project  

Hi! I'm Kelvin, and this is a personal project I built as part of my application to the Snap Engineering Academy 2025.  

I’m currently pursuing a career shift into computer science, but my path here has been non-traditional. I was previously a community college student before earning my undergraduate degree in Economics from UCLA. After graduating and working in finance, I realized that my true interests aligned more with software development and problem solving through code. So I made the leap — returning to school to complete prerequisite coursework in computer science with the goal of applying to Master’s programs in the field.  

This Pomodoro Timer project represents both my technical growth and my personal journey to become more intentional with my time and focus. The Pomodoro method has been a helpful system for improving how I work and stay engaged. I wanted to design a version of the timer that felt personal — clean, simple, and infused with the kind of quotes that keep me motivated and grounded.  

While I’ve worked with Python and done some basic game development using Pygame, this was my first time building a full front-end web project from scratch and deploying it using GitHub Pages. Learning JavaScript was an interesting challenge — many concepts felt familiar coming from Python, but I still had to self-teach a lot of the syntax and browser-based behavior. I relied heavily on online documentation, YouTube tutorials, and developer communities like Stack Overflow to build up my understanding.

## 🎯 Features  

- 25-minute Pomodoro mode  
- 5-minute Short Break  
- 15-minute Long Break  
- Start / Pause / Reset controls  
- Random motivational quote shown each session  
- Tab-based mode switching with clear visual feedback  
- Responsive layout that adapts well to phones, tablets, and desktop screens

## 🔧 How It Works  

- Built using plain **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** — no libraries or frameworks.  
- Timer logic updates the display every second.  
- Motivational quotes are stored in a JavaScript array and randomly selected.  
- Switching tabs (Pomodoro, Short Break, Long Break) updates the timer and UI accordingly.  
- GitHub Pages is used to deploy the site.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments  

- Inspiration came from the Pomodoro Technique itself and my own experience needing structured focus blocks while studying and tutoring.  
- All quotes are hard-coded from various authors/philosophers I admire — no API used.  
- Thanks to Snap Academies for encouraging creative and technical growth!  

**Resources I used to help guide this project:**  
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) – for understanding the DOM and JavaScript methods  
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) – helpful for CSS layout and timer logic  
- [YouTube: Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) – great visual CSS tips  
- [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://pages.github.com/) – to publish the live version of this project  
- Stack Overflow and ChatGPT for debugging and clarity on vanilla JS syntax
